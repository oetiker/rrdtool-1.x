=head1 NAME

rrdflushcached - Flush the values for a spcific RRD file from memory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> B<flushcached>
S<[B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>]>
I<filename> [I<filename> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<flushcached> function connects to L<rrdcached>, the RRD caching daemon,
and issues a "flush" command for the given files. The daemon will put the
files to the head of the update queue so they are written "soon". The
status will be returned only after the files' pending updates have been
written to disk.

=item B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>

Address of the L<rrdcached> daemon. If not specified, the
RRDCACHED_ADDRESS environment variable must be set (see below).  For a
list of accepted formats, see the B<-l> option in the L<rrdcached>
manual.
