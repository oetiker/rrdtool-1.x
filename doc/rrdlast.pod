=head1 NAME

rrdlast - Return the date of the last data sample in an RRD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> B<last> I<filename>
S<[B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<last> function returns the UNIX timestamp of the most recent
update of the RRD.

=over 8

=item I<filename>

The name of the B<RRD> that contains the data.

=item B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>

Address of the L<rrdcached> daemon. If specified, a C<flush> command is sent
to the server before reading the RRD files. This allows B<rrdtool> to return
fresh data even if the daemon is configured to cache values for a long time.
For a list of accepted formats, see the B<-l> option in the L<rrdcached> manual.

 rrdtool last --daemon unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock /var/lib/rrd/foo.rrd

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables may be used to change the behavior of
C<rrdtoolE<nbsp>last>:

=over 4

=item B<RRDCACHED_ADDRESS>

If this environment variable is set it will have the same effect as specifying
the C<--daemon> option on the command line. If both are present, the command
line argument takes precedence.
