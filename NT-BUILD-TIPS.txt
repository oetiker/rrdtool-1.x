Compiling RRDtool 1.1.x on Win32 with Microsoft Visual C++:
---------------------------------------------------------------
4/10/05 Tobi
The windows implementation of strftime does not seem to support
the ISO 8601 week number (%V) I have therfore included the file
strftime.[ch] which provides strftime_ ... if you compile rrdtool
with -Dstrftime=_strftime and link strftime.o then you will
get propper support for %V.

As of Jan 2004, code for libraries utilized by rrdtool 
(png, libart, freetype, and zlib) is no longer distributed with
rrdtool. This requires some changes to the compile process on
Win32. The solution described here is to compile rrdtool to
link against these libraries dynamically. There is an advantage
to this approach: namely the rrdtool distribution doesn't have to
worry about how to compile these libraries on Win32. In theory,
since others already provide and maintain Win32 binaries for these
libraries the users don't have to worry about how to compile them
either. The disadvantage of this approach is that the DLLs for
these libraries must be available on the hosts where rrdtool will run.

Here are step by step instructions for compiling rrdtool.exe and
the perl shared library (RRDS.dll) with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
(1) Download libraries rrdtool depends on from GnuWin32:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
For freetype, libpng, and zlib download the "Complete Package"; each of
these will be a self-extracting self-installing executable.
For libart, download both the "Binaries" and "Developer Files" packages.
Unfortunately at this time GnuWin32 doesn't provide the "Complete Package"
installer for libart. Perhaps by the time you are following these
instructions GnuWin32 will have a "Complete Package" for libart.
(2) Install the GnuWin32 libraries by running the executables for freetype,
libpng, and zlib. These instructions and the Visual C++ project files
distributed with rrdtool assume that you will use the default install
location: C:\Program Files\GnuWin32. Extract the two zip files for libart,
libart-2.3.3-bin.zip and libart-2.3.3-1-lib.zip into the GnuWin32 directory;
the appropriate libart files will be added to the include, lib, and bin
subdirectories.
(3) Add C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin to the PATH (Control Panel ->
System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables).
(4) Start Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. Load the workspace file, rrdtool.dsw,
from the src subdirectory of your rrdtool code directory.
(5) Compile the Release build of the rrdtool project (since rrdtool depends
on the rrd project, the rrd library will also be compiled). At this
time, the compile will fail in zconf.h, a zlib header file. The problem
is a preprocessor directive that loads unistd.h. Open zconf.h in VC++
(this file is in C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include) and find the following
code block:

#if 1           /* HAVE_UNISTD_H -- this line is updated by ./configure */
#  include <sys/types.h> /* for off_t */
#  include <unistd.h>    /* for SEEK_* and off_t */
#  ifdef VMS
#    include <unixio.h>   /* for off_t */
#  endif
#  define z_off_t  off_t
#endif 

Change it to reads as follows (this is code from zlib-1.1.4):

#if HAVE_UNISTD_H
#  include <sys/types.h> /* for off_t */
#  include <unistd.h>    /* for SEEK_* and off_t */
#  ifdef VMS
#    include <unixio.h>   /* for off_t */
#  endif
#  define z_off_t  off_t
#endif 

Note that it is actually just a one line change. Save the file and
recompile rrdtool. By the time you are following these instructions
this issue with zconf.h may be resolved.
(6) At this point, you can run the executable rrdtool.exe in the
src\toolrelease subdirectory. Note that if you wish to run rrdtool
on other machines, you will need the following DLLs installed (on the
path) on those machines:
zlib1.dll
libpng12.dll
libart_lgpl.dll
freetype6.dll
msvcrt.dll
The names of the first four DLLs might vary from what is listed here
depending on the versions of the packages you downloaded from GnuWin32.
The fifth DLL, msvcrt.dll, is a system DLL for most versions of Windows.
If you are running on old version of Windows, you can install/upgrade to
IE4.0 to get this DLL.
(7) To compile the perl-shared library, open a Command Prompt (DOS box)
and cd to the bindings\perl-shared subdirectory.
(8) Run vcvars32.bat; this batch file, in your vc98\bin directory will
set necessary environment options for command line compiling.
(9) In bindings\perl-shared, run
perl ntmake.pl
nmake
nmake test
If nmake test succeeds, you are good to go. RRDs.dll is in 
blib\arch\auto\RRDs. If you plan to install via the Active State ppm
tool, tar and gzip the blib directory. You can use the RRDs.ppd file
in bindings\perl-shared directory. Remember that as in the case of
rrdtool.exe you will need the DLLs listed in (6) on the machine where
you are going to use RRDs.dll.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 (.NET 2003):

Unfortunately, this is more difficult than with VC++ 6.0. The problem
is that by default the C runtime dll for VC++ 7.1 is msvcr71.dll rather
than msvcrt.dll. The GnuWin32 library binaries are all compiled
to use msvcrt.dll and you can't mix msvcr71.dll and msvcrt.dll in the
same process. One option is to download the source code for the libraries
(available from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) recompile them with
VC++ 7.l. Then all the components will use msvcr71.dll. Once you are
going to go this route, you can also use static multi-threaded libraries
and use static linking between rrdtool (or RRDs.dll) and its dependencies.

To use the GnuWin32 library binaries, you need to trick VC++ 7.1 into
compiling rrdtool to use the older msvcrt.dll. Follow steps (1) - (3)
as above, then:
(4) Obtain a different version of the msvcrt.lib import library that
is compatible with vc7 and points to msvcrt.dll:
msvcrtlib_for_vc7.zip from http://xchat.org/win32/testing
Backup msvcrt.lib in your vc7\lib directory 
(\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\vc7\lib)
Then extract the msvcrt.lib from the zip file into the vc7\lib directory.
WARNING: Use this msvcrt.lib at your own risk! This is not a Microsoft
supplied file nor a file supported by anyone associated with rrdtool.
(5) Start Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1. Load the solution file, rrdtool.sln,
from the src subdirectory of your rrdtool code directory. Edit zconf.h,
as needed, as described under (5) above. Compile the release build of
the rrdtool project.
Proceed with steps (6) - (9) as above, if you are using/picking up
the wrong msvcrt.lib import library then nmake test for perl-shared
will fail.

Note: it is possible in the future that GnuWin32 will provide Win32
binaries that utilize msvcr71.dll rather than msvcrt.dll.

These notes share some insight I gained compiling 1.1.x with
MS Visual C++ 6.0 (using project files). This information may or
may not be accurate at the time you are reading this.

(1) freetype and rrdtool cannot use precompiled headers (which are
enabled by default for MSVC++ projects).  MSVC++ 6.0 does not
support precompiled headers if #include directives contain MACROS.
(2) Compile Release build with Default optimization, not the
Maximize Speed optimization. I encountered some strange errors
(related to argument processing for complex commands like graph--
perhaps the getopt stuff is too blame) with Maximize Speed.
(3) libart relies upon config.h (ostensibly generated by the
configure script-- but of course not on Win32 platforms). ..\..\confignt
(which contains a static Win32 version of config.h) should be on
the include path.
(4) Fonts are located in the %windir%\fonts, so the default font
is c:\winnt\fonts\cour.ttf. (6/19/02) At Kerry Calvert's suggestion
this setting was moved to confignt\config.h.
(5) libart requires a custom build step to generate art_config.h; this
is done manually via the commands:
cl -I..\..\confignt gen_art_config.c
gen_art_config.exe > art_config.h

Currently, to compile rrd.lib and rrdtool.exe using
the MSVC++ project files, first start MSVC++ 6.0. Open the rrdtool
workspace (rrdtool.dsw in the src directory). The active project/
configuration should be rrdtool-Win32 Release. Select Rebuild All
from the Build menu. The static link library (rrd.lib) will
be generated in src\release directory and executable will be generated
in the src\toolrelease directory.

Compiling RRDtool on NT ... work in progress
---------------------------------------------------------------
                         by Tamas Kovacshazy (khazy@mit.bme.hu)

Persisting Problems with the current NT port:

Unfortunately, the RRD perl modules does not work with Perl
(ActivePerl) using the current distribution.

The RRD shared perl module can be compiled after some
modification...

Follow these steps:

0. Install perl if you do not have it!
   Visit http://www.ActiveState.com/pw32/ for a complete distribution.

1. Copy ..\gd1.2\release\gd.lib  to ..\gd1.2\
2. Copy ..\src\release\rrd.lib to ..\src
3. perl Makefile.pl

In this step the system complains about something I do not
understand. The error message is the following:

Note (probably harmless): No library found for '-lm'

Is a library missing? But it does not stop with an error...

4. nmake test (You must have Visual C++ on the machine!)

After these steps it generates the test files (svgs and rrds),
and they seem to be good.

The real problem in the shared perl modul is the following:

I do not know how this installation stuff works. The problem is
that the installation stuff looks for the gd.lib and the
rrd.lib in the ..\gd1.2 and ..\src directory. The UNIX compile
puts the files into these directories, but the NT compile does
not.

It is all for today,
