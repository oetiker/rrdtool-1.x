Win32 Build Instructions:

1) See build-rrdtool.dot (build-rrdtool.svg or build-rrdtool.pdf) for build
   dependency.

2) If you do not want to build the build-dependencies, you can download prebuilt
   versions from the following address:

   32bit dependencies should then be extracted into the contrib directory:
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/

   64bit dependencies should then be extracted into the contrib-x64 directory:
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/dependencies/


3) If you don't already have stdint.h for your system you can download it
   from the following address:

4) Adjust the include path, library path, and library names which in the
   Makefile.msc, to correspond with your local path or names.

5) Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile.msc' for 32 bit Windows target,
   Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile.msc USE_64BIT=1' for 64 bit Windows target.
   Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile.msc clean' to remove all generated files.

6) librrd-4.dll, librrd-4.lib, rrdtool.exe, rrdupdate.exe, rrdcgi.exe, and
   these corresponding pdb files will be located in the win32 directory.
