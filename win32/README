Win32 Build Instructions (using nmake Makefile):

1) See build-rrdtool.dot (build-rrdtool.svg or build-rrdtool.pdf) for build
   dependency.

2) An efficient way, to obtain up-to-date build-dependencies, is using vcpkg.
   Install the headers and libraries the following way into the vcpkg directory:
   .\vcpkg install cairo expat fontconfig freetype gettext glib libpng libxml2 pango pcre zlib --triplet x86-windows
   .\vcpkg install cairo expat fontconfig freetype gettext glib libpng libxml2 pango pcre zlib --triplet x64-windows

   If you do not want to build the build-dependencies, you can download prebuilt
   (but in the meantime outdated) versions from the following address:

   32bit dependencies should then be extracted into the contrib directory:
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/

   64bit dependencies should then be extracted into the contrib-x64 directory:
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/
   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/dependencies/


3) If you don't already have stdint.h for your system you can download it
   from the following address:
   http://msinttypes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stdint.h

4) Adjust the include path, library path, and library names found in
   Makefile_vcpkg.msc or Makefile.msc, to correspond to your local path or names.

5) Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile_vcpkg.msc' for 32 bit Windows target,
   Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile_vcpkg.msc USE_64BIT=1' for 64 bit Windows target.
   Run 'nmake -f win32\Makefile_vcpkg.msc clean' to remove all generated files.

   If you use headers and libraries in the contrib or the contrib-x64 folder,
   use Makefile.msc instead of Makefile_vcpkg.msc in the three commands above.

6) librrd-8.dll, librrd-8.lib, rrdtool.exe, rrdupdate.exe, rrdcgi.exe, and
   these corresponding pdb files will be located in the win32 directory.

7) To install, copy these files which you required to their permanent location.

8) To build the binding module. Follow the instructions in the README file which
   under the subdirectory of 'binding/'.
